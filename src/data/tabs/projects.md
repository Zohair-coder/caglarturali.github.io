### Some of the projects I've worked on so far

- [Drexel Scheduler](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/drexel-scraper)
  Live Site: [scheduler.zohair.dev](https://scheduler.zohair.dev/)

  Developed a Python web scraper to scrape data from [Drexel Term Master Schedule](https://termmasterschedule.drexel.edu/webtms_du/) and [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) and visualized the data in a Grafana dashboard to help students find the course that they're looking for. Over 300 active users according to Google Analytics.

- [MarketSIM](https://gitlab.com/Zohair-coder/market-sim)

  Led a team of 4 to create a stock market simulator to invest with virtual currency using React.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL and web sockets to get real time stock data.

- [Course to Professor Graph Visualization](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/course-professor-graph-visualization) Live Site: [zohair-coder.github.io/course-professor-graph-visualization](https://zohair-coder.github.io/course-professor-graph-visualization/)

  Built a toy project to visualize the relationship between courses and professors in CCI using D3.js. It isn't meant to be useful, but it was a fun project to build.

- [What's In Your Fridge?](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/ci102-3teaml/whats_in_your_fridge)
  Live Site: [fridge.zohair.dev](https://fridge.zohair.dev/)

  Led a team of 5 to create a React webapp to help users find recipes based on ingredients they have in their fridge

- [AI Powered Blackboard POC](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/hackathon-2024) Live Site: [zohair-coder.github.io/hackathon-2024](https://zohair-coder.github.io/hackathon-2024/)

  As part of a hackathon, we build a proof of concept for an AI powered Learning Management System (LMS) that integrates with Blackboard. The idea was to use LLM's to help students with their assignments (without having to provide any of the syllabus/assignment/anything context since the LLM could talk to Blackboard which has all of this material already), and convert unstructured PDFs (e.g. syllabus) to structured content that would allow us to create features that would help students with their daily struggles (e.g. calculating what grade they'll get if they get a 60 on the next assignment without having to provide context of what their previous grades are since we already have those from Blackboard and the weightages of different components are scraped from the syllabus by the LLM). We started up a test server for Blackboard using AWS and Terraform, and build a site that would interact with it. We unfortunately didn't actually connect the site to an LLM, but we have the frontend working, so this site serves as a nice way to communicate what our ideas were.

- [Introduction to Programming](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/itp-website) Live Site: [itp.zohair.dev](https://itp.zohair.dev/)

  I taught an Introduction to Programming class to high school students in the summer of 2024. To deliver the class material, I created this website.

- [CST480 Course Website](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/cst480-website) Live Site: [cst480.zohair.dev](https://cst480.zohair.dev/)

My professor at Drexel University taught a class on Advanced Web Development. Although their content was great, the site wasn't very user-friendly. I built a website for them to make it easier to navigate and find the information students needed.

- [Crime and Justice Final Paper](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/cjs) Live Site: [cjs.zohair.dev](https://cjs.zohair.dev/)

  I mentioned I was a CS major to my Crime and Justice professor, and she suggested I write my final paper as a webpage instead of a traditional PDF document. I used docusaurus to create a website that was easy to navigate and had a few visualizations to help explain the data.

- [Drexel Course Notifier](https://github.com/Zohair-coder/Drexel-Course-Availability-Notifier)

  Built a web-scraper in Python3 that notifies students via email when their selected course has available seats, impacting over 130 students at Drexel University

  Participated in a Hackathon and worked primarily on the backend, using Node.js and MongoDB
